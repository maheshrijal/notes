### Starting docker containers
```sh
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webserver nginx
```
Start existing container: `docker container start -ai <name> <command>`

!!! note "How long do containers run?"
    Container run as long as the command that was executed on startup runs. Eg: If bash shell was executed on startup, the container will stop when the shell is terminated.

### List containers
List running containers: `docker container ls`

List all containers: `docker container ls -a`

### Viewing Logs
- View Logs for a container: `docker container logs name`

- Follow container logs: `docker container logs name -f`

- View logs help: ` docker container logs --help`


### Container config info & utilization: 
- View processes running inside a container: `docker container top`

- details of container config: ` docker container inspect name`

- performance stats of containers(stream): `docker container stats`


### Getting a shell inside a container
- Start a new container interactively (ontainer will stop when the shell/command is terminated): `docker container run -it` 

- Run a command inside exisiting container: `docker container exec -it`


### Cleanup

- To clean an unused/dangling image: `Docker image prune`

- To remove an image that is not used in a container: `Docker image prune -a`

- To prune the entire system: `Docker system prune`

- To kill all running containers: `Docker kill $ (docker ps -q)`

- To delete all stopped containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`

- To delete all images: `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`

!!! note ""
    A running container cannot be removed unless stopped or using `docker container rm -f name`
