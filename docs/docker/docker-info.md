# Docker version, docker client & docker server information

### Docker client/engine version
```sh
docker version
```

### Docker engine configs
Shows information about containers & images as well
```sh
docker info
```

### Docker CLI structure
- Old: `docker <command> (options)`
- New: `docker <command> <sub-command> (options)`


### Isolation mode for windows containers

- `process isolation`: multiple container instances run concurrently on a given host sharing the same kernel with the host as well as each other. Same as how Linux containers run.

- `Hyper-V isolation`: Offers enhanced security and broader compatibility between host and container versions. With Hyper-V isolation, multiple container instances run concurrently on a host; however, each container runs inside of a highly optimized virtual machine and effectively gets its own kernel. The presence of the virtual machine provides hardware-level isolation between each container as well as the container host.
