# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- S3 allows to store objects (files) in buckets (directories)
- Bucket names are gloablly unique (across all AWS accounts)
- Buckets are defined at region level
- Max bucket size is 5TB (5000 GB)
- If uploading more than 5GB use "multi-part upload"

## Amazon S3: Security

#### User Based

- **Iam Policies** - API calls allowed or denied for speciric users

#### Resource Based

- **Bucket Policies** - Bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account (most common)

- **Object Access Control Lists (ACL)** - finer grained (can be disabled)

- **Bucket Access Control Lists (ACL)** - less common (can be disabled)


### S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
- Effect: Allow/Deny
- Actions: Set of API to allow or deny
- Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
