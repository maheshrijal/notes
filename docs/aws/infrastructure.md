# AWS Infrastructure

### Regions
Regions are physical locations around the world with a cluster of data centers. Each AWS Region consists of a minimum of three, isolated, and physically separate AZs (Data Centers) within a geographic area.

### Availability Zones

An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data center with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZ's are very useful for high availability, fault tolerance & disaster recovery.

### Edge Locations / Points of Presense
To deliver content to end users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of 450+ Points of Presence and 13 regional edge caches in multiple cities / countries. This is done by partnering with telecom carriers globally.
